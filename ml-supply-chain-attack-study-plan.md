# ML Supply Chain Attack Study Plan

## 1. Core Concepts (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Introduction to ML Supply Chain Attacks**
  - Define ML supply chain attacks and their impact on data, model integrity, and overall system security.
  - Identify vulnerabilities in the ML lifecycle (e.g., data poisoning, model tampering, compromised dependencies).
- [ ] **Key Terminology and Frameworks**
  - Understand concepts such as data poisoning, backdoor attacks, third-party model dependencies, and supply chain integrity.
  - Review the typical stages of an ML pipeline where vulnerabilities can be introduced.

## 2. Attack Techniques and Case Studies (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Common Attack Methods**
  - Study data poisoning techniques: how malicious data can be injected into training sets.
  - Explore model tampering and backdoor insertion during the training process.
  - Learn about attacks targeting third-party dependencies (e.g., pre-trained models, external libraries).
- [ ] **Case Studies and Real-World Examples**
  - Analyze documented cases (e.g., BadNets, Trojan attacks) to understand attack vectors and outcomes.
  - Review academic papers and industry reports detailing ML supply chain vulnerabilities.

## 3. Practical Experiments (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Experimentation Environment Setup**
  - Build a controlled ML pipeline using open-source tools and datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
  - Reproduce simple attack scenarios such as data poisoning and model tampering.
- [ ] **Implementation and Testing**
  - Implement basic attack techniques to observe their effect on model performance.
  - Experiment with detection and mitigation strategies to evaluate their effectiveness.

## 4. Defense and Mitigation Strategies (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Preventive Measures**
  - Learn about secure data validation, model verification, and dependency management practices.
  - Explore tools like DVC (Data Version Control) and Sigstore to track and secure ML artifacts.
- [ ] **Detection and Response**
  - Study techniques for identifying anomalies in data pipelines and model outputs.
  - Evaluate methods for auditing model provenance to detect compromised components.

## 5. Extended Learning & Community Engagement (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Stay Updated with Research**
  - Follow recent publications, journals, and industry news on ML security and supply chain attacks.
  - Subscribe to relevant blogs, newsletters, and forums.
- [ ] **Collaborative Projects and Open-Source Engagement**
  - Contribute to or monitor open-source projects focusing on ML security.
  - Participate in community challenges and discussions to share insights and best practices.
