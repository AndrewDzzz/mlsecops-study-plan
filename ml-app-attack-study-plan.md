# ML Application Attack Study Plan

## 1. Core Concepts (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Introduction to ML Application Attacks**
  - Define what constitutes an ML application attack.
  - Understand the ML attack surface across the data, model, and deployment pipeline.
- [ ] **Key Terminology**
  - Define critical terms: adversarial examples, data poisoning, model extraction, model inversion, backdoor attacks.
  - Distinguish between attacks targeting training data versus those exploiting deployed systems.

## 2. Common Attack Techniques (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Adversarial Attacks**
  - Study methods like FGSM, PGD, and CW for crafting adversarial examples.
  - Understand how these attacks affect model predictions and application reliability.
- [ ] **Data Poisoning Attacks**
  - Learn how malicious data can be injected during training to corrupt model behavior.
  - Analyze case studies highlighting the impact of poisoning attacks.
- [ ] **Model Extraction & Inversion**
  - Explore techniques for reconstructing models via API queries or side-channel information.
  - Understand the privacy and intellectual property implications of model extraction.
- [ ] **Backdoor & Trojan Attacks**
  - Investigate methods for inserting covert backdoors into models.
  - Assess how backdoors compromise ML application security when triggered in production.

## 3. Practical Experiments (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Experimental Environment Setup**
  - Build a controlled ML pipeline using open-source tools and datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10).
  - Deploy open-source models (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch implementations) for testing.
- [ ] **Implementation of Attacks**
  - Reproduce adversarial attacks using libraries like Foolbox and CleverHans.
  - Conduct experiments on data poisoning, model extraction, and backdoor attacks.
- [ ] **Evaluation and Analysis**
  - Measure attack success rates, model performance degradation, and data leakage risks.
  - Document results and analyze patterns in attack behaviors.

## 4. Defense and Mitigation Strategies (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Preventive Measures**
  - Study secure development practices for ML applications, including data validation and model verification.
  - Explore techniques such as adversarial training, anomaly detection, and secure API design.
- [ ] **Post-Attack Detection and Response**
  - Learn methods for real-time detection of adversarial inputs and poisoning attempts.
  - Evaluate defense strategies like input sanitization and robust model verification.
- [ ] **Tool-Based Approaches**
  - Implement and test tools such as IBM AI Fairness 360 for risk assessment and mitigation.

## 5. Extended Learning & Community Engagement (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Stay Updated**
  - Follow the latest research, conferences, and industry news on ML security and application attacks.
  - Subscribe to newsletters, blogs, and forums focused on ML security.
- [ ] **Collaborative Projects**
  - Contribute to or monitor open-source projects in ML security.
  - Engage with communities to share insights, best practices, and new defense techniques.
