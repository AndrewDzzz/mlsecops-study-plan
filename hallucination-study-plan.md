# Hallucination Study Plan

## 1. Core Concepts (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Introduction to Hallucination in LLMs**
  - Define hallucination: when a model generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or fabricated information.
  - Understand the impact of hallucinations on trust, reliability, and safety in AI systems.
- [ ] **Common Causes of Hallucination**
  - Data quality issues and distribution mismatches.
  - Limitations in model training and lack of grounding.
  - Overgeneralization and exposure bias.

## 2. Understanding Mechanisms (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Model Architecture and Generation Process**
  - Study how transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT, BERT) generate responses.
  - Analyze the role of autoregressive generation and temperature settings.
- [ ] **Case Studies and Research Findings**
  - Review examples of hallucination in real-world applications.
  - Examine research on model memorization and factuality issues.

## 3. Mitigation Techniques (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Post-Processing and Verification**
  - Techniques for verifying generated content against reliable sources.
  - Use of external knowledge bases and fact-checking APIs.
- [ ] **Training and Fine-Tuning Strategies**
  - Incorporate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to reduce hallucinations.
  - Explore calibration methods and controlled training to improve factuality.
- [ ] **Evaluation Metrics**
  - Define metrics to assess factuality and the frequency of hallucinated outputs.
  - Compare model outputs before and after applying mitigation techniques.

## 4. Practical Experiments (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Experimental Setup**
  - Deploy an open-source language model (e.g., GPT-2 or GPT-Neo) in a controlled environment.
  - Create test prompts designed to trigger hallucination.
- [ ] **Testing Mitigation Strategies**
  - Implement baseline experiments to measure the rate of hallucination.
  - Apply mitigation techniques (e.g., prompt engineering, RLHF) and evaluate improvements.
- [ ] **Documentation and Analysis**
  - Record experimental results, including both successes and failures.
  - Analyze trends and identify best practices for reducing hallucinations.

## 5. Extended Learning & Community Engagement (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Stay Informed**
  - Follow recent research papers, workshops, and conferences focused on LLM factuality and reliability.
- [ ] **Collaborative Projects**
  - Engage with communities (e.g., on GitHub or AI ethics forums) to share findings and discuss new ideas.
- [ ] **Open-Source Contributions**
  - Contribute to or initiate projects aimed at detecting and mitigating hallucinations in language models.
