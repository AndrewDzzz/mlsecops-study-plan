# Fairness Study Plan

## 1. Core Concepts (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Introduction to AI Fairness**
  - Define fairness within AI and machine learning contexts.
  - Understand the differences between fairness, equity, and equality.
- [ ] **Common Challenges in AI Fairness**
  - Identify sources of bias in data, models, and algorithms.
  - Discuss how systemic issues can propagate in AI systems.

## 2. Fairness Theories and Metrics (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Fairness Theories in AI**
  - Group Fairness: Ensuring equal treatment across demographic groups.
  - Individual Fairness: Treating similar individuals similarly.
  - Counterfactual Fairness: Assessing fairness based on causal reasoning.
- [ ] **Key Fairness Metrics**
  - Demographic Parity
  - Equal Opportunity & Equalized Odds
  - Calibration and other statistical fairness measures

## 3. Fairness in Machine Learning (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Identifying Bias in AI**
  - Examine data collection, labeling, and sampling biases.
  - Analyze how algorithmic decisions may lead to biased outcomes.
- [ ] **Bias Mitigation Techniques**
  - Pre-processing: Data rebalancing and bias correction.
  - In-processing: Incorporating fairness constraints in model training.
  - Post-processing: Adjusting model outputs to reduce bias.
