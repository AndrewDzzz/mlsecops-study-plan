# Jailbreak Study Plan

## 1. Core Concepts (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Introduction to Jailbreaks in LLMs**
  - Define jailbreaks and understand their role in bypassing safety and moderation in language models.
  - Differentiate between benign prompt manipulation and harmful jailbreak techniques.
- [ ] **Risks and Ethical Considerations**
  - Explore the potential risks of jailbreaks for misinformation, abuse, and data leakage.
  - Discuss ethical guidelines and responsible disclosure practices when experimenting with jailbreaks.

## 2. Jailbreak Techniques (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Direct Jailbreak Techniques**
  - Injection-based approaches: directly altering the prompt to bypass restrictions.
  - Prompt manipulation: crafting prompts that trick the model into ignoring safety instructions.
- [ ] **Indirect Jailbreak Techniques**
  - Chain-of-thought bypasses: influencing multi-turn conversations to override safety.
  - Contextual jailbreaks: using background context or subtler cues to trigger unwanted responses.
- [ ] **Case Studies & Documented Examples**
  - Review documented jailbreak cases and analyze how they were executed.
  - Study repositories and online examples (e.g., ChatGPT jailbreak demonstrations on GitHub).

## 3. Tools and Practical Experiments (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Experimentation Setup**
  - Set up a safe sandbox environment for testing jailbreak techniques using available LLM interfaces.
  - Use open-source models (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-Neo) to safely experiment without affecting production systems.
- [ ] **Reproducing Jailbreak Examples**
  - Reproduce existing jailbreak prompts from community repositories.
  - Record both successful and failed attempts, noting any patterns or vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - Maintain a detailed log of experiments, including prompts used and model responses.

## 4. Defense and Mitigation Strategies (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Understanding Provider Countermeasures**
  - Review how model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) address jailbreak vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Mitigation Techniques**
  - Investigate techniques such as prompt filtering, context sanitization, and dynamic safety layers.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of these defenses through controlled experiments.
- [ ] **Developing Recommendations**
  - Propose recommendations for improving LLM safety and reducing susceptibility to jailbreaks.

## 5. Extended Learning & Community Engagement (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Stay Informed**
  - Follow the latest research and news on LLM safety and jailbreak techniques.
- [ ] **Community Involvement**
  - Participate in forums, GitHub projects, and security communities focused on AI safety.
  - Engage in discussions on responsible disclosure and ethical research practices.
