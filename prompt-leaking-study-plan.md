# Prompt Leaking Study Plan

## 1. Core Concepts (1-2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Introduction to Prompt Leaking**
  - Define prompt leaking in the context of large language models (LLMs).
  - Understand how sensitive or private information can be inadvertently exposed through crafted prompts.
- [ ] **Privacy Risks and Data Memorization**
  - Explore the concept of model memorization and its role in prompt leakage.
  - Differentiate prompt leaking from related phenomena (e.g., prompt injection, adversarial extraction).

## 2. Techniques and Attack Methods (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Understanding Leakage Mechanisms**
  - Study how LLMs can memorize training data and under what conditions leakage occurs.
  - Review methods for extracting internal model information using crafted prompts.
- [ ] **Case Studies and Examples**
  - Analyze documented instances and research studies on prompt leakage.
  - Focus on techniques used to trigger and measure data extraction from models.

## 3. Defense and Mitigation Strategies (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Mitigation Techniques**
  - Explore methods to reduce memorization (e.g., regularization, controlled training).
  - Study the application of differential privacy in model training.
- [ ] **Secure Prompt Design**
  - Develop guidelines for designing prompts that minimize leakage risks.
  - Evaluate strategies for post-training data filtering and sanitization.

## 4. Tools and Practical Experiments (2-3 Weeks)
- [ ] **Set Up a Testing Environment**
  - Deploy an open-source LLM (e.g., GPT-2 or similar) for experimentation.
  - Implement baseline extraction attacks to assess prompt leakage.
- [ ] **Experiment with Defense Mechanisms**
  - Integrate differential privacy techniques using libraries such as TensorFlow Privacy or PyTorch Opacus.
  - Measure the impact of mitigation strategies on both leakage and model performance.

## 5. Extended Learning & Community Engagement (Ongoing)
- [ ] **Stay Informed**
  - Follow recent research, workshops, and conferences focused on LLM privacy and security.
- [ ] **Collaborative Projects**
  - Contribute to open-source projects or discussion forums on LLM security.
  - Share findings and best practices through blog posts or technical reports.
